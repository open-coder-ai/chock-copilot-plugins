</p>

An agent you're running can already touch your shell, your git history, and your CI config.
You want it to move fast without being the reason a stray `rm -rf` actually happens. Telling
it to be careful in a prompt is not a guarantee; a plugin that can refuse the command is
closer to one — and it should be honest about which of those two it is.

## Install

```
# VS Code / GitHub Copilot: add this repository as a plugin marketplace, then install a
# plugin by name. See the Copilot plugins marketplace and VS Code's agent-plugins docs:
#   https://github.com/github/copilot-plugins
#   https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/agent-plugins
```

These packages use the Claude plugin format, which VS Code and GitHub Copilot CLI read
natively (VS Code auto-detects the format and sets `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` for the hook).

## What you get

Two kinds of package enforce here, and they enforce differently.

**Guard policies** ship a `PreToolUse` hook that judges a shell command before it runs. The
adapter always exits 0 and carries its verdict as JSON on stdout (`permissionDecision: "deny"`),
so the refusal is the client reading that answer, not an exit status.

**Gate policies** judge what a turn writes rather than what it runs. In the `copilot/` tree
they are wired at `Stop`, re-reading what the turn left on disk; the `claude/` tree adds
`PreToolUse` on the write tools, judging the file a write would create.

Both need `python3` on PATH: without it a fail-open client allows silently. A guard that
crashes is handled per that client's description; a gate that cannot reach a decision refuses
rather than allowing something it never judged. Advisory policies are a skill the client reads;
they shape behaviour but cannot block anything on their own. See **[PLUGINS.md](PLUGINS.md)** for the full list: each
policy, its version, whether it enforces or advises in this client, and a catalog link.

## Generated from chock-catalog

Every file here is compiled from policy sources in
[chock-catalog](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-catalog) by
[chock](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock). Pull requests against this repository are
closed automatically — open them against the catalog instead.

- **Generated only:** CI regenerates from the pinned catalog and fails on any difference.
- **Byte-identical guards:** each guard script is a verbatim copy of its policy's source in the
  catalog, and the hook adapter a verbatim copy of its framework source.
- **Best-effort, not a boundary:** guards are pattern-based filters; see
  [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
- **Tested upstream, and gated:** every policy ships an eval suite
  (`base/<policy>/evals/suite.yaml`) in the catalog, and the publish workflow runs
  `chock check` and `chock check --only evals` before packaging anything — a policy whose
  evals fail cannot reach this repository. The tests live in the catalog because the policy
  source does; this repository is compiled output.
- This README is hand-written, as are `SECURITY.md` and the workflows under `.github/`, so they
  sit outside the generated-only guarantee.

### Verify it yourself

Nothing above asks for trust that cannot be checked. This rebuilds the published tree from
source and compares it with what is committed here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-copilot-plugins dist
git clone https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock-catalog catalog
git clone --branch "$(tr -d '[:space:]' < catalog/.framework-ref)" \
  https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock framework
pip install ./framework
chock plugin build --repo catalog --policies-dir base --format agent-plugins --out-dir dist
chock plugin build --repo catalog --policies-dir base --format claude --out-dir dist
chock plugin build --repo catalog --policies-dir base --format copilot --out-dir dist
chock marketplace build --dist dist
git -C dist diff --exit-code && git -C dist status --porcelain
```

Silence from both `git` commands means this repository is byte-identical to a fresh build
from the catalog. The framework ref comes from the catalog's own `.framework-ref`, which is
what the publish and Generated-only workflows read, so this recipe cannot drift from the
release a tree was actually built with.
`chock-market.lock` records a sha256 per published plugin directory, so one package can be
checked without rebuilding the rest.

**If you are listing these plugins in a marketplace,** pin both a tag and the full commit
SHA. The tag names the release; the SHA is what holds the reviewed bytes still.
