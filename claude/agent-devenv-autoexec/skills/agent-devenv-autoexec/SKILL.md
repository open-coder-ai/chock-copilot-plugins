# Flag Dev Tools That Run Code on Open

Warns only (observe): flags files that make a dev tool run code on open, clone or shell entry -- agent hooks, helpers, env/BASE_URL overrides, auto-approve; VS Code folderOpen tasks, trust off, repo executables; devcontainer initializeCommand; .envrc, mise, husky, lefthook, pre-commit; gitconfig exec keys, gitattributes drivers, unsafe .gitmodules. Commit, agent write, turn's end; additions only; unreadable configs refused. Friction: misses interpreted code and unlisted files.

```
devenv_autoexec(agent hooks|helpers|env overrides|auto-approve|folderOpen tasks|trust off|devcontainer lifecycle|.envrc|mise|git hooks|gitconfig exec|gitattributes drivers|.gitmodules): changed by people only
never(add): hook|task|helper|env override|auto-approval; observe: warns at commit+tool_use, enforce later
```

This policy warns, and does not block, through the PreToolUse and Stop hooks installed with the plugin, subject to the fail conditions stated in the plugin description. Repo-wide enforcement across every commit and in CI still needs `chock sync`. See https://github.com/open-coder-ai/chock
